# Global Guidelines

This directory defines global, repository‑wide rules that every agent (broker, boss, worker1, worker2, and future roles) must strictly follow. These guidelines are normative and override local conventions.

Documents:
- global_rules.md — Operational and behavioral rules all agents must obey.
- contracts.md — Message shapes (meta/needs/result) and MCP tool conventions.
- project_structure.md — Required filesystem layout for projects, sessions, outputs, and snapshots.

All maintainers should keep these guidelines in sync with roles, configs, and runtime code.
